## Introduction
FlowModel provides a simple entry point for experimenting with AI and machine learning. It allows users to start with a minimal framework and extend it by creating and adding plugins. The framework is designed to focus on simplicity, modularity, and extensibility.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- `pip` package manager

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/FlowModel.git
   cd FlowModel
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # For Unix/MacOS
   .venv\Scripts\activate   # For Windows
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Directory Structure
```plaintext
FlowModel/
â”œâ”€â”€ main.py             # Entry point for the application
â”œâ”€â”€ plugins/            # Directory for plugins
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ __init__.py     # Initializes the plugin package
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ example_plugin.py # Example plugin
â”œâ”€â”€ data/               # Placeholder for datasets
â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt    # Python dependencies
â”œâ”€â”€ utils.py            # Utility functions
```

## Usage

### Training a Model
To train a model using FlowModel, run:
```bash
python main.py train
```
This will load any available plugins from the `plugins/` directory and apply their logic during the training process.

### Adding Plugins
To add a plugin, place a `.py` file with your plugin class in the `plugins/` directory. FlowModel automatically detects and loads plugins at runtime.

---

## Creating Plugins
Plugins extend the functionality of FlowModel. To create a plugin:

1. **Create a new Python file in the `plugins/` directory**:
   ```bash
   plugins/my_plugin.py
   ```

2. **Define your plugin class**:
   ```python
   class MyPlugin:
       def __init__(self):
           print("MyPlugin initialized.")

       def modify_model(self, model):
           print("MyPlugin: Modifying the model.")
           return model

       def on_train_start(self):
           print("MyPlugin: Training started.")

       def on_train_end(self):
           print("MyPlugin: Training finished.")
   ```

3. **Use your plugin during training**:
   When `main.py` runs, it automatically loads your plugin and calls its methods.

---

## Command-Line Interface
FlowModel includes a simple CLI for interacting with the framework.

### Commands
- **Train**: Start the training process with plugins.
  ```bash
  python main.py train
  ```
